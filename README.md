# Osrs dps calc
Dps calculator made for OSRS.  

Im not professional coder so some code might be a little rough. Made this as a hobby and for fun mainly.  
I can tell that the program works on windows 10, but no idea if it works on other windows versions. Most likely wont work on linux. And sorry mac users, no can do.  

Current version is demo version V1.1.0  
Future version will include more gear, and more monsters. If there is something that is "must have", let me know.

If you have feedback about the program, id gladly take it. Mainly looking for things that would be "must have" and overall look and feel of the program. Things that are not clear/easy to do, or just annoying to do.  

If there are any bugs, with the program itself doing something unexpected, or if the output values for dps calc are clearly wrong. Please inform me about it. Also typos, there are probably plenty of those.  

If you are reading trough the code i have written, i hope you are hungy as there is quite a lot of spaghetti for now. Plan is to rewrite the main dps code some day.

You can send message to me via discord or ingame.
