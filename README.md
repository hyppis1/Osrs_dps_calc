# Osrs dps calc
Dps calculator made for OSRS.  

Im not professional coder so some code might be a little rough. Made this as a hobby and for fun mainly.  
I can tell that the program works on windows 10, but no idea if it works on other windows versions. Most likely wont work on linux. And sorry mac users, no can do.  

Current version is demo version V1.1.0

If you have feedback about the program, id gladly take it. Mainly looking for things that would be "must have" and overall look and feel of the program. Things that are not clear/easy to do, or just annoying to do.  

If there are any bugs, with the program itself doing something unexpected, or if the output values for dps calc are clearly wrong. Please inform me about it.  

You can send message to me via discord or ingame.
